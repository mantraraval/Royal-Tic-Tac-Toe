Make the classic game delightful, fast, and easy to hack on. This repository hosts a minimal, dependency‑free web implementation of Tic‑Tac‑Toe that you can open directly in a browser or serve locally.

---

### Highlights
- **Zero setup**: Open a single HTML file and play.
- **No frameworks**: Plain HTML/CSS/JS for maximum clarity.
- **Instant hacking**: Great starter project for DOM events, state, and UX polish.
- **Portable**: Works offline; no build tools required.

### Quick Start
Choose any method below.

1) Open directly (simplest)
- Navigate to `Tic-Tac-Toe/tictactoe.html`
- Double‑click to open in your default browser

2) Live Server (VS Code)
- Install the "Live Server" extension
- Right‑click `Tic-Tac-Toe/tictactoe.html` → "Open with Live Server"

3) Local HTTP server (Python)
- From the repo root:
```bash
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
python -m http.server 5500
```
- Open `http://localhost:5500/tictactoe.html`

---

### How to Play
- Click on any empty cell to place your mark.
- Two players alternate until one forms a 3‑in‑a‑row (rows, columns, diagonals) or the board is full (draw).
- Use the reset/new game control (if present) or refresh the page to start over.

---

### Features (Current and Potential)
- Human vs. human on one device
- Detects wins and draws
- Clean, responsive board layout

Enhancements you can add next:
- Move history and undo/redo
- Single‑player mode with AI (minimax / alpha‑beta pruning)
- Scoreboard and match series (best‑of‑N)
- Animations and sound effects
- Theming (dark mode, high‑contrast)
- Mobile haptics and PWA (installable offline app)

---

### Development
- Open `Tic-Tac-Toe/tictactoe.html` in your editor.
- Scripts and styles can be embedded or split out as you refactor.
- Keep the code readable and dependency‑free unless you have a strong reason.

Recommended conventions:
- Prefer semantic HTML for accessibility.
- Keep functions small and single‑purpose.
- Name variables descriptively (e.g., `currentPlayer`, `boardState`).
- Avoid deep nesting; favor early returns.

---

### Testing (Manual)
- Verify win detection in all 8 lines (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals).
- Confirm draw state when the board is full with no winner.
- Test resets between rounds.
- Try on desktop and mobile; ensure taps/clicks behave consistently.

Optional automation ideas:
- Add basic unit tests with a tiny test runner in the browser.
- Extract pure logic (board evaluation, winner checks) into testable functions.

---

### Accessibility Checklist
- All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard (Tab/Enter/Space)
- Focus states are visible
- Sufficient color contrast for marks and win lines
- ARIA roles/labels for the board and cells

---

### Performance Tips
- Keep DOM updates minimal; update only changed cells
- Avoid layout thrashing (batch style changes)
- Use CSS for transitions/animations where possible

---

### Roadmap
- [ ] Add a polished UI with clear win/draw messaging
- [ ] Implement reset button and per‑round scoreboard
- [ ] Add single‑player mode with minimax AI
- [ ] Add move history with time‑travel
- [ ] Package as a PWA (offline, installable)
- [ ] Set up simple CI to lint HTML/CSS/JS

### Contributing
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your‑feature`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: add your feature"`
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your‑feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

Style guidance:
- Keep the code dependency‑free and easy to read
- Use descriptive names and early returns
- Explain non‑obvious logic with brief comments above the code

---

### FAQ
**Do I need Node or a build step?** No. It’s a static HTML file.

**Will it run offline?** Yes. Open the HTML file directly or convert to a PWA.

**Can I use this for teaching?** Absolutely—this is a great first JS/DOM project.

### License
Choose a license that suits your needs (e.g., MIT). If unsure, MIT is a good default. Add a `LICENSE` file when decided.
